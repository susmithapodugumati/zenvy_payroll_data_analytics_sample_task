Key Payroll & Workforce Insights
The analysis shows that total payroll expenses are significantly influenced by overtime payments and attendance irregularities. Certain departments contribute a higher share of payroll costs, which may indicate workload imbalance or inefficient shift planning. Employees with consistently high overtime hours require further review to ensure compliance with company policies.

Payroll Risks & Anomaly Detection
Several payroll risks were identified through the dashboard. Salary leakage was observed where overtime payments were processed despite missing or incomplete attendance records. Duplicate salary credit patterns were also detected for a small number of employees, pointing to possible system or process-level issues. In addition, salary payments without corresponding attendance data raise potential ghost employee concerns.

Data Quality & Compliance Observations
Missing attendance data remains a major challenge affecting payroll accuracy. Duplicate employee records and inconsistent employee IDs increase the risk of incorrect salary processing. Improving data validation and standardization will significantly enhance payroll reliability and audit readiness.

Executive Recommendations
It is recommended that ZENVY strengthens overtime approval controls and ensures salary payments are strictly linked to verified attendance data. Automated alerts for duplicate payments and anomaly detection should be implemented. Optimizing workforce allocation and improving attendance compliance can help reduce unnecessary payroll costs and improve governance.
Overall, the dashboard enables leadership to move from manual payroll tracking to proactive, insight-driven decision-making.
